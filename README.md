# TinyML ðŸ§®

## Description

This is a work-in-progress package that implements classical ML algorithms from scratch in pure Python. Correctness of implementation is ensured via unit & integration tests against respective implementations of the `scikit-learn` package.

## Badges

> On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use [Shields](https://shields.io/) to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals

> Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like [ttygif](https://github.com/icholy/ttygif) can help, but check out [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

Make sure to have appropriate versions of Python and Poetry installed (as defined in `.python-version` and `.poetry-version`).

Install the project dependencies from the `pyproject.toml` via:

```
poetry install
```

Install the pre-commit hooks from the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` via:

```
poetry run pre-commit install
```

## Usage

> Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support

> Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap

> If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing

> State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

> For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

> You can also document commands to [lint the code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting) or [run tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation). These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) server for testing in a browser.
