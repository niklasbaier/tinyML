While learning the theory is one thing, actually implementing these algorithms from scratch and without the help of modern frameworks such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, or Hugging Face's Transformers and Diffusers, is quite another. Thus, with this project, I want to deepen my understanding of the inner workings of the most well established machine learning algorithms.</p> <p>Aside from the actual implementation of these algorithms in pure Python, I also want to use this project to familiarize myself with writing a proper Python package that is released via <code>pip</code>, and can be imported into upcoming, ML-based projects.</p>"},{"location":"reference/","title":"Reference","text":"<p>This part of the project documentation focuses on an information-oriented approach.
