This site contains the project documentation for the
`instant-repo` project.
Its aim is to provide a ready-to-go project skeleton that has been built according to best practices.

## Table of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

In addition to that, the following is also included

- [Information about the Author](author.md)
- [Automated Changelog](changelog.md)
- [Information about the Project's License](license.md)
- [Statement of Motivation](motivation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.

This project template bundles many of the best practices I'm learning at work through my peers, and seniors. It also includes a lot of wisdom of the crowd from various corners of the internet, so I'm thankful for everyone out there who spends time & resources to help out beginners!
