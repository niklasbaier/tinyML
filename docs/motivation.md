When I started my first job as an Associate ML Engineer, and hence moved from coding in isolation to collaborating with experienced developers, I was awestruck how incredibly well and professional the codebases were set up compared to anything I have worked with before.

However, everything had _already_ been set up, and I was eager to learn how to properly create a new coding project completely from scratch on my own. Thus, the idea for this project template repository was born.

Now, with this template as a basis, I can rapidly work on new pet projects that follow many best coding practices, without having to set things up again and again from scratch. Instead, I will continuously work on this template and update it with new learnings and findings.
