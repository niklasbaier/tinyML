Being an (Associate) ML Engineer, I feel it to be my duty to understand classical and modern machine learning algorithms in-depth. While learning the theory is one thing, actually implementing these algorithms from scratch and without the help of modern frameworks such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), or Hugging Face's [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) and [Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index), is quite another. Thus, with this project, I want to deepen my understanding of the inner workings of the most well established machine learning algorithms.

Aside from the actual low-code implementation of these algorithms in pure Python, I also want to use this project to familiarize myself with writing a proper Python package that is released via `pip`, and can be imported into upcoming, ML-based projects.
